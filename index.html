    <h2>How to take a Healthly appoarch your Freshmen Year</h2>
    <p>The first year of college can be a fun, exciting but sometimes challenging time. With stressors like deadlines, group project and exams, it can all be a bit much. Starting your first year of college, people often of things like books that they will need, finding a doom room or even a part time job to help with the experience of school, those things do matter but there is also something else that plays a big part to your success at school, and that is your health. Below I have liked some video’s that I found helpful in my first year.  A lot has to do with Mindfulness Mediation. I do believe a calm mind has an easier time learning or that you will be able to complete stressful test and exams if you can just take a breath and relax.  </p>
